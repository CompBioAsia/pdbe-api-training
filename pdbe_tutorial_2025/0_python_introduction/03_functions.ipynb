        "Functions are an essential component to any programming language. They allow us to compartmentalise a block of code and then call that code again and again, wherever we need it, with only a single command. For example, if you wanted to sort a list of strings alphabetically and you were given five lists, one approach could be to write the code in full to sort each of the five lists. With functions, we can instead write the code to sort the list once and simply call that code whenever we need to sort a new list. \n",
